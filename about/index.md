            I've gone by Candy since my sister
            came up with that name while eating candy in the hospital.

        <p> I'm a recent UC Berkeley graduate with a fancy-sounding
            simultaneous degree in Computer Science and Business Administration.
            I'm interested in studying and shaping people's experiences through 
            user-centered design, while leveraging my background to see the 
            bigger picture and implement my ideas.
