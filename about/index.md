        <p> I'm a recent UC Berkeley graduate with a fancy-sounding
            simultaneous degree in Computer Science and Business Administration.
            I'm interested in studying and shaping people's experiences through 
            user-centered design, while leveraging my background to see the 
            bigger picture and implement my ideas.

### The starting line

Here are pages from the [Google Slides "notebook"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zAgX1IilTdYWSKQWYP9j3YLfbWRNDJ-2lGKjARezA8k/edit?usp=sharing "full project notebook") 
I used during my 
first stab at doing UI/UX design. I was working on an ambitious robotics control
system project that would get students more interested in the programming aspects
of robotics. I think it's a good way to get to know me --- 
though back then I didn't know a thing about the design process.

I started self-studying after hitting some difficult design questions, and 
discovered some classics, like *The Design of Everyday Things*. I was elated 
and disappointed all at once. There was so much to learn! But there was so 
much to fix about this project if I really wanted to make something that 
would be good for students.

These are my humble beginnings. I welcome you to check out the rest of my 
portfolio, to see the exploring and growing I've been doing since.
