        <p>Hi! My name is Candace Chang. I've gone by Candy since my sister
            came up with that name while eating candy in the hospital.
        </p>
        <p> I'm a recent UC Berkeley graduate with a fancy-sounding
            simultaneous degree in Computer Science and Business Administration.
            I'm interested in studying and shaping people's experiences.
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to browse through my portfolio, and check out my resume on 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/candyichang">LinkedIn</a>.
