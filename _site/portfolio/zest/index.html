<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>An IoT cooking experience integrating sensors and existing devices. 
Worked with a team of five mechanical engineers. Class project for ME110, 
New Product Development. Prompt from our sponsors, Samsung: 
“Leisure and Entertainment,” ideally something using speakers and sensors.</p>

<h3 id="involvement">Involvement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Participated in all aspects of product development process</li>
  <li>Created interactive prototypes in Marvel and Invision</li>
  <li>Prepared decks and led presentations</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>Pencil and paper, whiteboard, post-its, Marvel, Invision, Adobe Illustrator</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<h3 id="concept-generation">Concept Generation</h3>

<p>We were given a broad prompt “make an IoT product within the theme of Leisure
and Entertainment” and told we could do pretty much what we wanted. As a
result, we revisited the brainstorm stage many times and conducted several rounds of 
interviews as we slowly narrowed our focus to enhancing the cooking experience.</p>

<figcaption>Some of the ideas I contributed to the brainstorming sessions</figcaption>

<p>I learned a lot by visiting people in person and asking 
them to show me how they did things. For example, one of my interviewees 
said he enjoyed listening to music and talkshows while cooking, but didn’t bring
up anything inconvenient about the process. When I asked 
to see how he set up his cooking space, however, he grabbed his laptop and 
placed it on top of the trashcan! It had become such a regular thing for him 
that he didn’t think to bring it up when I asked at first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/trashcan_music.jpg" alt="laptop on trashcan" itemprop="image" height="300px" /></p>

<p>The user needs we concluded from our interviews:
- control devices without getting them dirty or breaking workflow
- adapt to changing environment with little user involvement (sounds, placement in the kitchen)
- improve cooking skills
- share accomplishments with friends family
- figure out what to cook</p>

<h3 id="prototypes">Prototypes</h3>

<p><img src="/images/zest_midterm_prototypes.jpg" alt="three prototypes" itemprop="image" height="300px" /></p>

<p>We created three different prototypes for our midterm tradeshow. They each tested a 
different aspect of our cooking ideas. Mr. Pan was the interactive cooking teacher,
the Smart Cutting Board could display videos and recipes, and Basket was a cooking
challenge app where friends could challenge each other to cook with random ingredients.</p>

<p>The prototypes were at different levels of fidelity and functionality to test different
things. Mr. Pan was hooked up to an Arduino and would react to someone “cooking” inside
of it. The Smart Cutting Board was literally an iPad displaying a few screen mockups. 
Basket was a low-fi interactive prototype made in Marvel, to see if people understood
the concept and found it interesting.</p>

<p>I was in charge of creating the Basket prototype. I chose to use Marvel as my prototyping
tool because I could take pictures of my sketched mockups and turn those directly into
my prototype. I didn’t want to create something in Illustrator or Photoshop so early on,
because that would keep people from giving feedback on the concept itself.</p>

<div class="centered">
  <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/d95b0j?emb=1" width="330" height="640" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>We distributed surveys to everyone who tried our products, asking when and how often they
would think about using the product, as well as what their experience with the prototype was
like. We also asked which of the products they enjoyed the most out of the three. We collected
approximately 30 surveys total. The responses confirmed most of the conclusions from our user interviews,
and brought a few new insights.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Users wanted notifications and alerts during the cooking process.</li>
  <li>They didn’t want to buy an entirely new device or kitchen appliance - they would prefer if the product
were sold separately and could integrate with their existing products</li>
  <li>They liked having recipe suggestions.</li>
  <li>They wanted to be able to control their music while cooking.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="concept-selection">Concept Selection</h3>

<p><img src="/images/zest_concept_selection.jpg" alt="concept matrix" itemprop="image" height="300px" /></p>

<p>Post-tradeshow, we evaluated the three prototypes against what we learned from 
the survey feedback. Mr. Pan and the Smart Cutting Board both were well-received
at the tradeshow. People liked the learning aspect, as well as the integrated
nature of the controls. One problem they had with both devices, however, was
that they would have to buy a completely new appliance in order to get these
features.</p>

<p>When we conducted competitive analysis, we also found a Mr. Pan-like product on 
Kickstartr already — an intelligent pan that used temperature information
to help users cook more accurately. There were also a variety of recipe and
cooking apps for smartphones and tablets out in the market already.
To figure out how to find a competitive advantage in this market, we made
a concept matrix and decided to create a completely new product, taking
relevant ideas from each prototype.</p>

<p>The key change from our previous prototypes was a shift from an intelligent
cooking device, to sensors that could be attached to existing appliances.
To lock down finer details of our new prototype, we conducted
about 30 more short interviews to find the most needed features.</p>

<h3 id="final-prototype">Final Prototype</h3>
<p><img src="/images/zest.jpg" alt="zest demo" itemprop="image" height="300px" /></p>
<figcaption>Sensor set-up demo. The prototypes were 3-D printed by one of my teammates.</figcaption>

<p>Zest is a collection of sensors that can be attached to various cooking implements
and cookware. When they sync with the mobile application, they can provide
contextual cooking instructions and notifications. The sensors also act as
volume control, so no matter where you are in your kitchen you can adjust your
entertainment as you wish.</p>

<p><img class="centered-img" src="/images/zest_roadmap.png" alt="recipe flow" itemprop="image" /></p>
<figcaption>Stages of an amateur cook</figcaption>

<p>We designed Zest with the above roadmap in mind. I spoke with many people who
didn’t cook regularly, or wanted to but weren’t able to for one reason or another.
For some people, it was really about avoiding doing dishes; for others, the 
“ominvore’s dilemma” struck them every time they opened the fridge to try and
figure out what to cook. Some people simply didn’t want to touch raw food
or go through the effort of preparing it when take-out was readily available.</p>

<p>We wanted to make a product that could support people at every stage of the
cooking process, transitioning them from finding it a chore, to becoming eager
to learn more, to getting creative and sharing their success. We even thought
about adding an “orchestra mode,” where music would change according to
a user’s actions in the kitchen — a throwback to Mr. Pan.</p>

<p>I was in charge of creating the mobile app portion of the prototype. It was
challenging to work out the recipe screens, and they could have done with
more user testing if we had the time. Zest provided not only cooking instructions,
but music control as well — this meant parceling out screen estate accordingly
and deciding what to show and what to hide away.</p>

<p><img src="/images/zest_prototype_stitched.jpg" alt="rough UI sketches" itemprop="image" height="300px" /></p>

<p>This time I used Invision to string together the views, since we
wanted something more polished to test out at the final showcase. Invision can
only handle one orientation at a time, though, so the prototype is split into
two parts for easier desktop viewing.</p>

<p>Since we changed product ideas near the end of the semester, we didn’t get
to test Zest out with that many users. If we had more time, I would have wanted to
do some actual kitchen testing with this prototype. Would they be comfortable with 
these sensors stuck all over their appliances? Do the steps and the cooking timers 
make sense? An important consideration our mentors told us to think about was 
repeatability. Would sensor set-up be troublesome enough that users would decide
not to integrate it into their usual workflow?</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>An important lesson learned from this project was how to factor in design 
within a business context. How can you design something that can win market 
share from other products, or generate a primary market, like Apple once did 
with the iPhone? Coming up with something that meets user needs is a first step, 
but other considerations come into play — available technology, profitability, 
manufacturability, sustainability and so on. A product can only survive if it 
manages to balance everything; no wonder iteration is so often a fitting 
development method.</p>

<p>Another big part of this experience was working within a multi-disciplinary team.
It was great to see different perspectives from my teammates, who 
were mechanical engineers, with one also pursuing architecture and one
doubling with EECS. If I had been on a team of only CS students, I think we 
would have mostly explored software-only solutions. With more variety in thinkers at 
the table, we managed to explore many more possibilities!</p>
