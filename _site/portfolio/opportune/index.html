<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A proof-of-concept for a Qualcomm Toq smartwatch app for recruiters. 
Class project for CS160, User Interface Design. Worked on a team of five
computer science majors; we split the roles into two designers, three
developers.</p>

<h3 id="involvement">Involvement</h3>
<p>For this project I was most involved in user research and visual design.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participated in brainstorming and illustrated initial selected concepts</li>
  <li>Performed contextual inquiry with Palantir recruiters, then crafted our 
personas using the information</li>
  <li>Made hi-fi mockups for Toq watch and Android views</li>
  <li>Created presentation decks and led pitches</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>Pencil and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<h3 id="brainstorm">Brainstorm</h3>
<p>We brainstormed possible smartwatch applications as a group, clustering similar
ideas together and building off of other people’s ideas.</p>

<img src="/images/mango_innovations_firstideas-4.jpg" alt="carpool app" width="220px" /></p>

<p>I illustrated our top three concepts to present at our initial design review.
In the end, however, we chose a fourth idea that we bounced around during the 
review session: an app that would enable users to exchange contact information 
using common hand gestures. We further narrowed down our focus user group to 
recruiters and job seekers at career fairs.</p>

<h3 id="user-studies">User Studies</h3>

<p><img src="/images/career_fair.jpg" alt="career fair sketches" itemprop="image" height="300px" /></p>

<p>I visited career fairs to make observations and find interview subjects. Happily, 
at one engineering career fair, I even got permission to perform contextual inquiry 
with a group of Palantir recruiters. Here are some of the observations and takeaways.</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/270261772%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-SYHe8&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>Career fairs are really crowded, busy and loud. If you put something down or give 
something away it’s hard to keep track of it. Reaching over tables to put away 
stacks of collected resumes, or to just get a water bottle, is physically inconvenient.
Having someone at the table coordinating is extremely useful, especially when trying
to grab things or put things away is difficult due to lack of space. Getting people’s
attention is difficult due to the noise. In addition, the layout and space constraints 
mean that even tapping someone on the shoulder isn’t an easy task.</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>

<p>Handshake and greeting come before looking at resume. The goal is to get personal 
face time with candidates and carry on a conversation.</p>

<p>Note-taking: The engineers and recruiters take short notes, usually only three or 
four lines. They never write on the front of resumes to avoid bias, only the back. 
Palantir uses post-its, in addition to having a pen and clipboard for the resume. 
Post-its go on the back of the clipboard; they’re there in case there are doublesided
resumes, or there are people who didn’t bring resumes and they need to write down 
contact info. Things to write down:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The initials of whoever talked to the student, for later reference</li>
  <li>The student’s interest/possible team</li>
  <li>Internship/full time</li>
  <li>If there was a technical question, the problem and the rating</li>
</ol>

<p>Post-fair, recruiters will have to manually scan the resumes into whatever CMS
they use to track applicants. This is the part of the process that has some
companies turning to using tablets at career fairs. Palantir doesn’t use them,
however, because they’ve found it stalls conversations and causes backlog.</p>

<p><strong>Quantitative Observations</strong></p>

<p><em>These are rough counts.</em></p>

<p>The average number of students at the booth was 8.4. This was a pretty high number
in comparison to many other booths, given Palantir’s popularity. Keeping wait
times down is important because some students will just leave if they have
to stand in line for too long. Palantir’s recruiters aim for five minutes per
person, but it’s really hard to keep to that goal.</p>

<p><img src="/images/palantir_student_graph.png" alt="students at booth over time" itemprop="image" /></p>

<p>Things they carried: the top five ways students held their resumes</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plastic or other cheap folder (26)</li>
  <li>Just papers (18)</li>
  <li>File folder (16)</li>
  <li>Notebook (7)</li>
  <li>Manila envelope (4)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Based on the findings from this contextual inquiry, as well as other user interviews
conducted by teammates, we came up with a few important user needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facilitate face-to-face conversations with candidates</li>
  <li>Note down necessary information about candidate during conversation</li>
  <li>Collect all information in a way that eliminates the need for manual entry</li>
  <li>Manageable with only one free hand, limited movements and loud surrounding environment</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="prototype-design">Prototype Design</h3>

<p><img src="/images/toq_tagging.jpg" alt="tagging candidate info" itemprop="image" /></p>

<p>We designed our prototype to fulfill features based on the key user needs
we highlighted from our studies: contact exchange, tagging, and third-party 
integration.</p>

<p>We initially hoped to implement note-taking, but given the Toq watch’s limited
capabilities, as well as the small screen estate, we turned
to tagging instead. This was a viable alternative, since our user studies 
showed that recruiters take very little notes, and they usually have predictable
inputs that can be set beforehand.</p>

<p>In order to make digital submission of information as painless as possible,
we felt the best way was to integrate with platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub
and Behance to help candidates showcase their experience and make it simple
to port all the information into a company’s CMS.</p>

<h3 id="ui-design">UI Design</h3>

<p>I was in charge of the visual/UI design for the prototype’s watch and mobile views.
This included designing the logo: a stylized representation of a handshake.</p>

<p><img class="centered-img" src="/images/opportune_logo.png" alt="opportune logo" itemprop="image" /></p>

<p>Designing for the Toq watch was mostly about figuring out what was
supported by the SDK, and what things to give up on at the design stage
because of hardware and software limitations. Possible interactions like
bumping watches or sliding cards across to each other were ruled out at
the sketching stage.</p>

<p><img src="/images/opportune_sketches_b.jpg" alt="toq sketches" itemprop="image" /></p>
<figcaption>Smartwatch sketches</figcaption>

<p>The biggest challenge for the mobile views was working out how to fit
so much information within a small screen. I ended up going with an
accordion pattern, with the main job title and company visible and
details hidden by default.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I learned a lot about designing around limitations during this
project. The watch form factor influenced all our technical and product decisions;
we had to set aside several of our ideas because they didn’t work with the small
screen estate or the possible modes of interaction. We also had to consider
likely user bases — smartwatches are not ubiquitous, and certain user groups,
like high-salaried tech workers, are more likely to have them.</p>

<p>We worked on this project around the time when the Apple Watch was first being
promoted. Smartwatch technology and design has advanced since then, and it’s
exciting to think that some of our early ideas might be possible to achieve now.</p>
