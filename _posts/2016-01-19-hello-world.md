I'm planning to use this as a digital sketchbook.
It's an experiment, half to get me to create more content on a regular basis, and half to log the random stuff I do have in my notebooks etc.

Sometimes it'll be writing, sometimes it'll be random crafts I've made for someone, sometimes it'll actually be sketches.

Let's see how it goes.
