## Overview

I worked on a team of five computer science/EECS students during the Spring 2016
semester to create a web application promoting community engagement and safety 
in Bernal Heights, San Francisco. Our client was the 
[Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/BHNC?code=Website+button "BHNC Link") (BHNC),
a small non-profit that provides social programs for seniors and youth, 
and fosters neighborhood activism to solve local problems.

### Involvement
Everyone on the team contributed to both design and implementation, which was 
a really great experience after group projects with mostly distributed roles. As
one of the two team members with some prior Rails experience, I was heavily involved
in implementation and learning how to manage testing and deployment.

* Full-stack, agile, TDD and BDD development on Ruby on Rails, following MVC and RESTful practices
* Design and implementation of the admin-side workflow for  staff accounts, hotspots and events
* Git repo, QA and deployment management
* Low-fi mockups, including the hotspot form experience on mobile devices
* In-person interviews and persona generation

### Tools

_Design_: Pencil and paper, whiteboard, POP, Adobe Illustrator, browser prototyping

_Development_: Ruby on Rails, Haml, Sass, Javascript, Pivotal Tracker, Travis CI, 
CodeClimate, Cucumber, Rspec, Heroku

## Process

### Constraints
Although we worked independently with our client, there were some
requirements in terms of process and technologies imposed by the class.

The instructors wanted us to stay within the realm of web development, using
Rails as our primary framework. We were also required to work in two-week 
iterations, submitting deliverables to our TAs at the end of each week. 
We completed four by the end of the semester. The typical iteration cycle:

* Week one: Client meeting, create user stories/mockups for the features this 
            iteration, write Cucumber/Rspec tests, meet with instructors
* Week two: Work on our stories until all tests pass green, deploy for user testing

### Client Needs
Based on conversations with Ailed, our point of contact, we set three main goals
for this app:

* Gather information about safety hotspots more efficiently; currently using
  paper forms
* Get both long-time and recent neighbors involved in community events
* Share useful resources with residents in one accessible location

### Personas

**BHNC Staff**

In order to decide *how* to go about implementing these features, I put together
personas for some primary users, as well as general observations about the
characteristics of BHNC and the Bernal Heights Neighborhood.

The residents of Bernal can be roughly divided into three groups:
1. Long-time residents: 3-generation families, from grandparents to grandchildren
2. Integrated residents: many artistic/creative/merchant personalities
3. Newest residents: younger, earning more money,  most likely working in tech

Out of the three, the ones with most involvement in BHNC are the first two groups.
One of the goals of this app was to pull in the third group while maintaining
involvement from the other two segments.
