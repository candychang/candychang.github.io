**Involvement**

* Full-stack, agile, TDD and BDD development on Ruby on Rails, following MVC and RESTful practices
* Design and implementation of the admin-side workflow for  staff accounts, hotspots and events
* Low-fi mockups, including the hotspot experience on mobile devices
* In-person interviews and persona generation
* Git repo, QA and deployment manager

## Background
I worked on a team of five computer science/EECS students
to create a web application promoting community engagement and safety in Bernal Heights, San Francisco.
Our client was the 
[Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/BHNC?code=Website+button "BHNC Link") (BHNC),
a small non-profit that provides social programs for seniors and youth, 
and fosters neighborhood activism to solve local problems.

**Goals**

1. Gather information about safety hotspots more efficiently; currently using paper forms 
   and processing by hand
2. Get both long-time and recent neighbors involved in community events
3. Share useful resources with residents in one accessible location
4. Lighten the workload on overworked staff


## Design

**Tools**: Pencil and paper, whiteboard, POP, Adobe Illustrator, browser prototyping

**Learning about Bernal**

One of their most successful programs is the hotspot walk. BHNC staff aggregate information
from residents about safety issues like abandoned cars or broken streetlights and then invite
the relevant city departments to walk around the neighborhood, see the hotspots, speak
to neighbors, and get a better picture of how to fix these problems.

## Development

**Tools**: Ruby on Rails, Haml, Sass, Javascript, Pivotal Tracker, Travis CI, CodeClimate, Cucumber, Rspec, Heroku

This class was focused on teaching us about software development methodologies, specifically
agile, TDD and BDD. We were required to work in two-week iterations, nominally fitting in four by the
end of the semester. The typical iteration cycle:

* Week one: Client meeting, create user stories/mockups for the features this iteration, write
            Cucumber/Rspec tests, meet with instructors
* Week two: Work on our stories until all tests pass green, deploy for user testing
