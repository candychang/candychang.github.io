Bernal Heights App promotes community engagement and
safety by collecting relevant information about the
neighborhood and making it accessible to residents
as well as BHNC staff.

## Overview

* Team: Tiffany Lam, Joyce Toh, Tanisha Singh, Bao Xie
* Role: Developer, Designer, DevOps
* Timeframe: Feb 2016 - May 2016
* Class: CS169 Software Engineering as a Service
* Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Sass, Javascript
* Process Tools: POPapp, Pivotal Tracker, Travis CI, CodeClimate

## Client & Needs
We worked with Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center (BHNC), a small non-profit in San Francisco
that focuses on social programs for seniors and youth, and fosters neighborhood
activism to solve local problems. Specifically, we worked with Ailed, the Public Safety and Community
Engagement Chair. This part of BHNC organizes hotspot walks, community meetings, and safety-awareness events.
Ailed wanted to:

* Gather hotspot information more efficiently; currently using paper forms and processing by hand
* Share useful resources with residents in one accessible location
* Get old and new neighbors involved in community events
* Lighten the workload on overworked staff
