I designed and wrote most of the copy for PiE's 2014-2015 report, which covers 
PiE during my year as director. As of spring 2016, sending out this report has 
helped raise over $10,000 in funding from sponsors. This is almost one-fourth of 
our typical operating budget, which was $45,000 for the 2014-2015 year. 

PiE's annual reports have historically been 15+ page word documents sent out to
sponsors at the end of every fiscal year. Design aside, the content of the
reports was often better for internal reflection than external reporting.
I focused the content on information relevant to sponsors and the general
public, leveraging photos and graphics to show our accomplishments.
