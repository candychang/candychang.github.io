PiE's annual reports have historically been 15+ page word documents sent out to
sponsors at the end of every fiscal year. I redesigned and wrote most of the
copy for the 2014-2015 report, which covers PiE during my year as director. 
I incorporated plenty of images and statistics to make our impact clearer to 
sponsors, alumni, the general public, and potential donors. As of spring 2016, 
sending out this report has helped raise over $10,000 in funding from sponsors.
