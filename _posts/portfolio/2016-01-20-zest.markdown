## Overview
An educational cooking experience integrating sensors and existing devices. 
Worked with a team of 5 mechanical engineers. Class project for ME110, 
New Product Development. Prompt from our sponsors, Samsung: 
"Leisure and Entertainment," ideally something using speakers and sensors. 

##Involvement
* Heavily involved in user interviews and advocating for user needs 
* Participated in all aspects of product development process: brainstorming, 
  concept generation, concept selection, prototyping, business analysis
* Created interactive prototypes in Marvel and Invision
* Prepared decks and led presentations

### Tools

Pencil and paper, whiteboard, post-its, Marvel, Invision, Adobe Illustrator

## Process

### User Needs

We were initially given a very broad prompt of "Leisure and Entertainment,"
so as a team we decided to focus on turning mundane tasks and chores into
entertainment. To discover a product customers would be interested in using, we
held two rounds of in-person interviews.

**Preliminary Interviews (20 interviews):**

Each team member interviewed at least three people about their hobbies, their
chores, and how they kept themselves entertained. I learned a lot by visiting
people in person and asking them to demonstrate their answers to my questions.
For example, one of my interviewees said he enjoyed listening to music and talk 
shows while cooking. When I asked to see how he set up his cooking space, he
grabbed his laptop and placed it on top of the trashcan! It had become such a
regular thing for him to do, he didn't think to bring it up in conversation.

**In-depth Interviews (22 interviews)
We classified three types of college students for the next round of interviews: 
people who cook daily, people who cook less regularly, and people who rarely or 
never cook. We interviewed at least 5 students of each type. By assessing 
interview responses based on their familiarity with cooking, we could further 
understand their pain points. For experienced cooks, being able to grasp timing
accurately was very important to them. For inexperienced cooks, we found that
the set up and clean up process prevented many from wanting to cook.There
were also some common themes that came up: the desire for hands-free control of 
devices and control over the cooking environment. 

We also asked interviewees to show us their cooking process so we could find 
any contradictions between what they said and what they actually do. 
From these interviews, we identified five key user needs for our product: hands-free, adapts to environment, improves cooking, shares with others, and encourages creativity.

3. Surveys (30 respondents)
Surveys from the midterm tradeshow were a great tool for us to gather more data 
and make sure that we were tackling the core user needs. These surveys helped 
us not only identify needs and pain points, but also ensured that the user needs 
we identified through our interviews were not limited to the people we interviewed. 
We also observed an interesting contradiction between what people said and what 
they do; namely, the majority of respondents responded that they think cooking 
is fun, but very few actually cook often. It also confirmed our hypothesis 
that if we could solve their pain points, the cooking experience could be 
educational and entertaining.
