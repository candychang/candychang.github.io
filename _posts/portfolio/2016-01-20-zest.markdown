## Overview
An IoT cooking experience integrating sensors and existing devices. 
Worked with a team of five mechanical engineers. Class project for ME110, 
New Product Development. Prompt from our sponsors, Samsung: 
"Leisure and Entertainment," ideally something using speakers and sensors. 

### Involvement
- Heavily involved in user interviews and advocating for user needs 
- Participated in all aspects of product development process: brainstorming, 
  concept generation, concept selection, prototyping, business analysis
- Created interactive prototypes in Marvel and Invision
- Prepared decks and led presentations

### Tools

Pencil and paper, whiteboard, post-its, Marvel, Invision, Adobe Illustrator

## Process

### Concept Generation

> *We need more ideas! We need more interviews!*

We were given a broad prompt "make an IoT product within the theme of Leisure
and Entertainment" and told we could do pretty much what we wanted. As a
result, we revisited concept generation many times and conducted several rounds of 
interviews as we slowly narrowed our focus to enhancing the cooking experience.

[Insert images of concept generation]

I learned a lot by visiting people in person and asking 
them to show me how they did things. For example, one of my interviewees 
said he enjoyed listening to music and talkshows while cooking, but didn't bring
up anything inconvenient about the process. When I asked 
to see how he set up his cooking space, however, he grabbed his laptop and 
placed it on top of the trashcan! It had become such a regular thing for him 
that he didn’t think to bring it up when I asked at first.
