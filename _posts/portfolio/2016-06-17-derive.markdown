## Overview
UI design for a hypothetical navigation application based on the Situationist's 
[dérive](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html Theory of the Dérive) , 
where one "drifts" in an unplanned way through a city, subconsciously guided
by the architecture and geography of the surroundings. 

Users of this application can choose a location, invite friends to
dérive to the destination as well, and then select the kind of wandering 
experience they would like to have before arriving at their destination.
In contrast to most navigation applications, which give you the fasted route
to your destination, Dérive's focus is on crafting a unique journey to that
destination.

### Tools
Illustrator, Photoshop, Framer.js

## Details
I really enjoyed the idea of wandering through a city, taking the time to really
look at the surroundings instead of worrying about the final destination.
I wanted the app to feel whimsical to users, with copy, visuals and interactions
encouraging them to explore.

### Visual Design

I usually start off with rough sketches of screens and how they flow together, 
but for this project, I started with the colors and patterns above. There
are far more colors than I usually work with, because I wanted to represent
the possibilities of adventure, and the many facets of a place waiting
to be explored.

The plane and the island were offhand explorations I made while working on the
background patterns. They fit the spirit of the app, so I ended up integrating
them into the visual design. The plane helped express movement from screen
to screen, and the island became the symbol for the final location.

### Interactions

Derive is supposed to inspire exploration, so I felt a typical form with
radio buttons or dropdowns would be too boring when it came to expressing
route preferences. Since the prompt required that users be able to 
customize several different elements of the trip, a more interesting
presentation would also keep users from feeling like stopping halfway through.

<div class="slick-carousel">
  <div>
    <img class="centered-img" src="{{ site.url }}/images/derive_activity_drawn.jpg" alt="activity level" itemprop="image">
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="centered-img" src="{{ site.url }}/images/derive_safety.jpg" alt="safety level" itemprop="image">
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="centered-img" src="{{ site.url }}/images/derive_environ_vars.jpg" alt="environment preferences" itemprop="image">
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="centered-img" src="{{ site.url }}/images/derive_randomizer.jpg" alt="randomizer" itemprop="image">
  </div>
</div>

For example, the typical question for activity level is something along the lines of 
"light, average, or heavy workout?" When you think about energy level and
typical workouts though, the intensity is rarely a constant amount. 
There are also physical limitations to consider; some people need to avoid 
stairs or hilly regions as much as possible. Being able to draw out how you'd 
like your journey to feel, instead of specifying these factors in words or
dropdown selections would be pretty interesting.

## Final Thoughts

This was my first time using Framer.js as a prototyping tool. It was a great
experience being able to code interactions for individual elements instead
of relying on the per-screen animations of tools like Marvel or Invision.

Looking back on this project, I just wanted to have more interesting 
interactions. Interesting, however, can't really trump usability. If
I had a second iteration of this prototype, these would be just a few
of the questions I'd work on: Is there some kind of confirmation that the app 
has interpreted your drawing correctly, and a way to adjust the result? How 
can a user tell right now what exactly a "safe" or a "risky" trip would
entail? Would a user have to repeat these settings each time they wanted
to go on a derive, or is there a way to save these customizations?

Even now, I'm still in love with the concept of the dérive, probably
because I find cultural landscape studies and thinking about how infrastructure 
and buildings impact how we act and feel to be really fascinating. It's similar 
to thinking about how physical and digital interfaces influence people's actions
and thoughts.

Moreover, in this age of Google Maps and door to door delivery for almost anything,
dérives would be a good reminder to savor the journey --- and make the effort
to have one in the first place! --- instead of skipping directly to the end.
