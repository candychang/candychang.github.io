I was a Design and UI/UX intern at [CaptureProof](http://captureproof.com/ CaptureProof link), 
a medical media startup that provides a HIPAA-compliant platform for sharing photos and video
between doctors and patients.

### iPhone Mockups

An example of the mockups I made for the iPhone app. For all my work, I first
sketched out ideas and ran them by the CEO. Once she was satisfied, I made
higher fidelity mockups in Photoshop. By the end of my internship I had produced 
mockups for all the main functionalities available in the mobile app at that time.

The CEO wanted a re-design of the onboarding process, to make the mobile
and web applications feel consistent. I was tasked with creating Balsamiq
wireframes for inviting patients and onboarding doctors through the web
app, then re-creating a similar flow with the mobile app.
