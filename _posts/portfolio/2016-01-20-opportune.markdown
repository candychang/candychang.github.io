## Overview
A proof-of-concept for a Qualcomm Toq smartwatch app for recruiters. 
Class project for CS160, User Interface Design. Worked on a team of five
computer science majors; we split the roles into two designers, three
developers.

### Involvement
For this project I was most involved in user research and visual design.

- Participated in brainstorming and illustrated initial selected concepts 
- Performed contextual inquiry with Palantir recruiters, then crafted our 
  personas using the information 
- Made hi-fi mockups for Toq watch and Android views
- Created presentation decks and led pitches

### Tools
Pencil and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator

## Process

### Brainstorm
We brainstormed possible smartwatch applications as a group, clustering similar
ideas together and building off of other people's ideas.

I illustrated our top three concepts to present at our initial design review.
In the end, however, we chose a fourth idea that we bounced around during the 
review session: an app that would enable users to exchange contact information 
using common hand gestures. We further narrowed down our focus user group to 
recruiters and job seekers at career fairs.


### User Studies

I visited career fairs to make observations and find interview subjects. Happily, 
at one engineering career fair, I even got permission to perform contextual inquiry 
with a group of Palantir recruiters. Here are some of the observations and takeaways.

**Environment**

Career fairs are really crowded, busy and loud. If you put something down or give 
something away it's hard to keep track of it. Reaching over tables to put away 
stacks of collected resumes, or to just get a water bottle, is physically inconvenient.
Having someone at the table coordinating is extremely useful, especially when trying
to grab things or put things away is difficult due to lack of space. Getting people's
attention is difficult due to the noise. In addition, the layout and space constraints 
mean that even tapping someone on the shoulder isn't an easy task.


**Process**

Handshake and greeting come before looking at resume. The goal is to get personal face
time with candidates and carry on a conversation. 

Note-taking: The engineers and recruiters take short notes, usually only three or 
four lines. They never write on the front of resumes to avoid bias, only the back. 
Palantir uses post-its, in addition to having a pen and clipboard for the resume. 
Post-its go on the back of the clipboard; they’re there in case there are doublesided
resumes, or there are people who didn’t bring resumes and they need to write down 
contact info. Things to write down:

1. The initials of whoever talked to the student, for later reference
2. The student’s interest/possible team
3. Internship/full time
4. If there was a technical question, the problem and the rating

Post-fair, recruiters will have to manually scan the resumes into whatever CMS
they use to track applicants. This is the part of the process that has some
companies turning to using tablets at career fairs. Palantir doesn't use them,
however, because they've found it stalls conversations and causes backlog.

**Quantitative Observations**

*These are rough counts.*

The average number of students at the booth was 8.4. This was a pretty high number
in comparison to many other booths, given Palantir's popularity. Keeping wait
times down is important because some students will just leave if they have
to stand in line for too long. Palantir's recruiters aim for five minutes per
person, but it's really hard to keep to that goal.

Things they carried: the top five ways students carried their resumes

1. Plastic or other cheap folder (26)
2. Just papers (18)
3. File folder (16)
4. Notebook (7)
5. Manila envelope (4)

**Final Thoughts**


Based on the findings from this contextual inquiry, as well as other user interviews
conducted by teammates, we came up with a few important user needs:

- Facilitate face-to-face conversations with candidates
- Note down necessary information about candidate during conversation
- Collect all information in a way that eliminates the need for manual entry
- Manageable with only one free hand, limited movements and loud surrounding environment

> Why haven't more people gone completely digital?

Paper resumes are the main contact exchange, despite the incovenience of
having to manually enter contact information into a CMS. Recruiters pick out items 
from the resume to start conversations with candidates, and during the debriefing
and selection process, they are sorted and passed around for everyone to view.
Note-taking with one hand is still more easily done with pen and paper compared
with typing on a touch keyboard.

On the recruiter end, handing out physical "swag" is an important way to attract
students to the booth, and to raise brand awareness. It's also a kind of status
symbol, signaling to students which companies are the "cool" ones.
