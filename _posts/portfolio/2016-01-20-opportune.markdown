## Overview
A proof-of-concept for a Qualcomm Toq smartwatch app for recruiters. 
Class project for CS160, User Interface Design. Worked on a team of five;
two designers and two developers.

### Involvement
For this project I was most involved in user research and visual design.

- Participated in brainstorming and illustrated initial selected concepts 
- Performed contextual inquiry with Palantir recruiters, then crafted our 
  personas using the information 
- Made hi-fi mockups for Toq watch and Android views
- Created presentation decks and led pitches

### Tools
Post-its, pencil and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator

## Process

### Brainstorm
We brainstormed possible smartwatch applications as a group, clustering similar
ideas together and building off of other people's ideas.

I illustrated our top three concepts to present at our initial design review.
In the end, however, we chose a fourth idea that we bounced around during the 
review session: an app that would enable users to exchange contact information 
using common hand gestures. We further narrowed down our focus user group to 
recruiters and job seekers at career fairs.

### User Studies

I visited career fairs to make observations and find interview subjects. Happily, 
at one engineering career fair, I even got permission to perform contextual inquiry 
with a group of Palantir recruiters.
