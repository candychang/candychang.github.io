## Overview
A proof-of-concept for a Qualcomm Toq smartwatch app for recruiters. 
Class project for CS160, User Interface Design. Worked on a team of five
computer science majors; we split the roles into two designers, three
developers.

### Involvement
For this project I was most involved in user research and visual design.

- Participated in brainstorming and illustrated initial selected concepts 
- Performed contextual inquiry with Palantir recruiters, then crafted our 
  personas using the information 
- Made hi-fi mockups for Toq watch and Android views
- Created presentation decks and led pitches

### Tools
Pencil and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator

## Process

### Brainstorm
We brainstormed possible smartwatch applications as a group, clustering similar
ideas together and building off of other people's ideas.

I illustrated our top three concepts to present at our initial design review.
In the end, however, we chose a fourth idea that we bounced around during the 
review session: an app that would enable users to exchange contact information 
using common hand gestures. We further narrowed down our focus user group to 
recruiters and job seekers at career fairs.


### User Studies

I visited career fairs to make observations and find interview subjects. Happily, 
at one engineering career fair, I even got permission to perform contextual inquiry 
with a group of Palantir recruiters.

Some observations:

- At career fairs, the goal is to get personal face time with candidates and carry on a conversation
- Collect 250-400 resumes per event. There are events on average every week. Recruiters can go to as many or as few as they want, depending on their role and their preferences.
- Aim for 5 minutes of face time with applicants, but in reality the times differ greatly
- Note-taking: short notes, usually only 3 lines. Type of job, area they're interested in, and recruiter's initials so other recruiters can follow up later. People recruiter want to follow up with right away will also get marked, and technical interview results are also noted. Short notes on the backs of resumes are for efficiency and for preventing bias.
- Currently gather contact information through resumes, or through tablet form entry. One company we observed tried using tablet but it intruded on conversation time and created lots of backlog, so they went back to hardcopy.
- Hard copy resumes need to be scanned by hand into whatever CMS the company is using.
- Applicants and recruiters usually have one hand free to shake hands and gesture. The other one is holding a clipboard, pen, folder, other career fair swag, and so on.
- Career fairs are really crowded, busy and loud. If you put something down or give something away it's hard to keep track of it. Reaching over tables to put away stacks of collected resumes, or to just get a water bottle, is physically inconvenient.
