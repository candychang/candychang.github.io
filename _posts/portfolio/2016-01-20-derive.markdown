## Overview
UI design for a hypothetical application that would give "wandering" directions 
to points of interest, instead of choosing the shortest route. Perfect for
exploring an new city, or having friends experience a unique journey before
meeting up somewhere.

### Tools
Illustrator, Photoshop, Framer.js

## Process
I really liked the idea of creating an app that would reinforce the philosophy
of "it's the journey that counts." It reminded me of family trips where our dad 
would suddenly improvise instead of following our planned directions...we would 
often end up pleasantly delighted, when we weren't too irritated by sitting long
hours in the car!

I wanted the app to feel whimsical - not too modern and serious, with both copy
and visual design encouraging the user to explore.
